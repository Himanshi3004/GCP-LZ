## Log Sampling Strategy

The module implements intelligent log sampling to balance observability with cost:

| Log Type | Default Sample Rate | Rationale |
|----------|-------------------|-----------|
| Critical Security Events | 100% (no sampling) | Zero tolerance for security blind spots |
| Audit Logs | 10% | Sufficient for compliance and investigation |
| Network Flows | 1% | High volume, patterns detectable at low rates |
| Application Logs | 5% | Balance between debugging capability and cost |
| Archive Logs | 0.1% | Long-term trends only |

## Alert Escalation

The module supports multi-tier alert escalation:

1. **INFO/WARNING** â†’ Email notifications
2. **ERROR** â†’ Email + Slack notifications  
3. **CRITICAL** â†’ Email + Slack + PagerDuty

## SLO Implementation

Service Level Objectives are implemented with:

- **Error Budget Tracking** - Automatic calculation and alerting
- **Burn Rate Alerts** - Early warning when consuming budget too quickly
- **Multi-window SLIs** - Both short-term and long-term tracking
- **Compliance Reporting** - Automated SLO performance reports

## BigQuery Analysis

The module creates several BigQuery views for analysis:

- `security_events_view` - Filtered security events with user attribution
- `network_analysis_view` - Network flow analysis for security investigation
- `daily_security_summary` - Automated daily security reports

## Cost Optimization Features

- **Intelligent Sampling** - Reduces log volume while maintaining visibility
- **Log Exclusions** - Filters out noisy, low-value logs
- **Tiered Storage** - Automatic lifecycle management for archived logs
- **Retention Policies** - Configurable retention based on log type
- **Cost Alerts** - Notifications for expensive operations

## Security Features

- **Zero-trust Logging** - All security events captured without sampling
- **Anomaly Detection** - ML-based detection of unusual patterns
- **Compliance Tracking** - Automated compliance report generation
- **Incident Response** - Integrated alerting and escalation
- **Audit Trail** - Complete audit trail for all administrative actions

## Monitoring Best Practices

The module implements Google's SRE best practices:

- **Four Golden Signals** - Latency, traffic, errors, saturation
- **Error Budgets** - Balance reliability with feature velocity
- **Alerting Hierarchy** - Symptoms before causes
- **Runbook Integration** - Alerts include remediation guidance
- **Noise Reduction** - Intelligent filtering and grouping

## Outputs

The module provides comprehensive outputs for integration:

- Dashboard URLs for direct access
