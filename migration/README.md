# Migration Tools

Tools and scripts for migrating workloads to the GCP Landing Zone.

## Migration Process

### 1. Assessment
```bash
# Run migration assessment
python3 assess.py PROJECT_ID

# Review assessment report
cat assessment_PROJECT_ID_TIMESTAMP.json
```

### 2. Migration Planning
- Review assessment recommendations
- Plan migration phases
- Schedule maintenance windows
- Prepare rollback procedures

### 3. Migration Execution
```bash
# Run migration
./migrate.sh PROJECT_ID ENVIRONMENT

# Monitor progress
tail -f migration.log
```

### 4. Validation
```bash
# Validate migration
python3 validate.py PROJECT_ID

# Run integration tests
cd ../tests
./run_tests.sh
```

### 5. Rollback (if needed)
```bash
# List available backups
ls -la backups/

# Rollback to previous state
./rollback.sh backups/terraform-state-backup-TIMESTAMP.json
```

## Migration Patterns

### Lift and Shift
- Minimal changes to existing workloads
- Focus on infrastructure migration
- Suitable for legacy applications

### Re-platforming
- Optimize for cloud-native services
- Update configurations
- Improve security posture

### Re-architecting
- Redesign for cloud-native patterns
- Implement microservices
- Leverage managed services

## Best Practices

### Pre-Migration
- Complete thorough assessment
- Test in non-production environment
- Prepare detailed runbooks
- Set up monitoring and alerting

### During Migration
- Follow phased approach
- Monitor system health
- Validate each phase
- Maintain communication

### Post-Migration
- Run comprehensive validation
- Monitor performance
- Optimize configurations
- Update documentation

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **State conflicts**: Use `terraform force-unlock`
- **Permission errors**: Verify IAM roles
- **Resource conflicts**: Import existing resources
- **Network connectivity**: Check firewall rules

### Emergency Procedures
1. Stop migration immediately
2. Assess impact and scope
3. Initiate rollback if necessary
4. Document issues and lessons learned
